🔒 PROMPT — Milestone 2.2

Availability Detection Extraction

You are working on the WatchDog repository.

TARGET MILESTONE: Stage 2.2 – Availability Detection Extraction

Extract availability detection logic into core/availability.ts.

Rules:
- copy logic exactly as-is
- preserve keyword lists and attribute checks
- no generalization
- no renaming for readability

checkMyPrices.ts must only delegate, not decide.

Explain explicitly why no behavior has changed.
