🔒 PROMPT — Milestone 2.3

Price Extraction Core

TARGET MILESTONE: Stage 2.3 – Price Extraction Core

Extract ALL price reading logic into core/price-extractor.ts.

This includes:
- standard price extraction
- MediaExpert split-price handling

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- MediaExpert remains a special case
- selectors are unchanged
- parsing logic is unchanged
- output values must be identical

No abstraction, no optimization, no refactor.
