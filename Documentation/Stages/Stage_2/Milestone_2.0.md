🔒 PROMPT — Milestone 2.0

Boundary Identification

You are working on the WatchDog repository.

TASK TYPE: ANALYSIS ONLY. NO CODE CHANGES.

Your task is to identify and list logical responsibility boundaries inside
watchdog/checkMyPrices.ts.

You MUST:
- read the file top to bottom
- group code into responsibility blocks
- name each block (e.g. cookie consent, availability detection, price extraction)
- specify line ranges for each block

You MUST NOT:
- refactor
- suggest improvements
- change any code
- introduce abstractions

Output:
- a bullet list of responsibility blocks
- each block with a short description
- exact line ranges

This step is documentation-only and prepares the next milestones.
