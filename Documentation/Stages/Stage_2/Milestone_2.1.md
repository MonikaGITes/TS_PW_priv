🔒 PROMPT — Milestone 2.1

You are working on the WatchDog repository.

TARGET MILESTONE: Stage 2.1 – Cookie Consent Extraction

You MUST:
- extract cookie consent logic from checkMyPrices.ts
- move it into a new file: core/consent.ts
- preserve behavior line-for-line

You MUST NOT:
- change keywords
- change iframe handling
- refactor logic
- simplify code

checkMyPrices.ts must continue to work identically,
only calling the extracted function.

Before coding:
- list files to be created
- list files that must not change

After coding:
- explain how behavior equivalence is preserved
